# About

A singleplayer mil-sim game, where you control a squad of NPCs to secure objectives. Has some similar visuals and gameplay mechanics to the late Surviv.io. Written with Pixi.js (graphics) and Matter.js (physics). Utilizes a custom, moduluar game engine that's currently in development.

# Development

Code is written in TypeScript and all modules are compiled into ES2015 using Webpack. No images/sounds are used, so that the project can run within Khan Academy's web enviroment.
